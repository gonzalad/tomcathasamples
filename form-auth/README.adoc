Sample application to illustrate HA setup with redisson plugin for Tomcat.

*ONLY docker method works for now* Running :

 * start a redis bd on localhost:6379.
 * execute `mvn clean integration-test cargo:run` +
   this will start tomcat on port 8080. +
   remote debugging is available on port 9009.
 * browse http://localhost:8080/form-auth/hello
 * enter the credentials username=admin password=<empty> +
   you should see the HTTP Status 400 - Invalid direct reference to form login page

Running as docker :

 * execute `mvn clean package -Pdocker`
 * execute `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml up` +
   this starts up the application behind a load balancer (accessible though 8080 port).
 * open your browser on http://localhost:8080/form-auth/hello
 * you can scale up the number of app with : +
   docker-compose -f src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml scale app=2
 * enter the credentials username=admin password=<empty> +
   you should see the HTTP Status 400 - Invalid direct reference to form login page

Additional information:

 * ha plugin is configured in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/META-INF/context.xml

Bugs:

 * redisson plugin doesn't work when we use Tomcat based form authentication. +
   Tomcat shows the login page whenever we try to access a previously authenticated
   session after killing/restarting tomcat. +
   To reproduce it :
+
```
mvn clean package -Pdocker
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml up
# access http://localhost:8080/form-auth/hello
# you'll get prompted for your credentials
...
# kill docker app container
docker kill `docker ps -a -q --filter="name=app"`
# restart app container
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml scale app=1
# access http://localhost:8080/form-auth/hello
# you'll get prompted for your credentials -> that's not normal, you should already been
# logged
...

```
